# Pet Stats

The PetStats is a original idea that I have, the app has a concept to help future owners of dogs to make the right decision based on the Status of each dog, the app basically says if the dog is Calm or Frenatic, Obedient or Desobedient and other stuffs. I pretend to go on with this app and expand him with the Firebase and put real datas about the dogs. I hope you enjoy the app idea :)
